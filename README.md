Project Background

This project involves creating a cafe app software application. The main functionality of the app is to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) product, courier and order entries for the cafe. 


Client requirements

- Products and couriers are maintained in a collection. The collection for week 4 requirements are lists of dictionaries.
- An order can be created on the system by a customer.
- Orders will have a status and can be updated.
- All data will be persisted when the app starts and when the app is exited.
- The app requires tests and must be functional.
- The app needs regular software updates.


How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

My design approach was experimental. I changed structure of my project every week to make it in line with that week's requirements, for example, I changed the menu structure from a while loop to a function. A plan from the start would of been the best approach but it's hard to decide on a design at this early stage of learning python. Having an experimental approach gave me the freedom to learn and understand different concepts while coding the app. The main downside to this is the accruement of technical debt.


How did you guarantee the project's requirements?

I guranteed the project's requirements by giving myself enough time. I made sure the core functionality was in place before moving on.


If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?

Test driven development. My code was hard to test when the requirements for testing were introduced. I would of had an easier time testing if I employed a TTD mindset from an earlier stage of development. 


What did you most enjoy implementing?

Coding the creation of ids in the order product_id_index dictionary key. I implemented a way to choose either one or multiple product ids and add them to the product_id_index order dictionary key. This involved adding actual keys for the products. An id would be removed if the product was deleted.
